Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
--------------------------------------------
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud as Amazon EC2 instances. 

Imagine you are responsible for the architecture of your company's resources and need to support new websites. With traditional on-premises resources, 
you have to do the following:

Spend money upfront to purchase hardware.
Wait for the servers to be delivered to you.
Install the servers in your physical data center.
Make all the necessary configurations.
By comparison, with an Amazon EC2 instance you can use a virtual server to run applications in the AWS Cloud.

You can provision and launch an Amazon EC2 instance within minutes.
You can stop using it when you have finished running a workload.
You pay only for the compute time you use when an instance is running, not when it is stopped or terminated.
You can save costs by paying only for server capacity that you need or want.


Amazon EC2 instance types
--------------------------
Amazon EC2 instance types are optimized for different tasks. When selecting an instance type, consider the specific needs of your workloads and applications.
This might include requirements for compute, memory, or storage capabilities.

Amazon EC2 pricing
--------------------
With Amazon EC2, you pay only for the compute time that you use. Amazon EC2 offers a variety of pricing options for different use cases. For example, 
if your use case can withstand interruptions, you can save with Spot Instances. You can also save by committing early and locking in a minimum level of 
use with Reserved Instances.
